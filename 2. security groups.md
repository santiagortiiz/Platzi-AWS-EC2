# Security Groups

Features
- Firewall:
    - Rules for the inbound and outbount traffic
    - Applies for communication ports and protocols
- Attached to a VPC in a region
- Can be applied to multiple EC2 instances in a VPC
- References between security groups in the same availability zone

Best Practices
- If you are going to use SSH, set up a dedicated security group

Classic ports
- 22: SSH | SFTP (secure file transfer protocol)
- 21: FTS (file transfer system)
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS
- 3389: RDP (remote desktop protocol) for Windows

SSH Notes:
The private key must not be accessible by others, so you need to change the permissions like this:
- chmod 400 <private_key_name>.pem
